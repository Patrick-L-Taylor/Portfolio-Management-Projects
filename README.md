# Investment Risk Management Project
This project on investment risk, focuses on the practical application of financial risk management concepts and tools, including the Treynor Ratio and Value at Risk.

## Course Overview
**Objective:** Apply key risk management concepts such as the Treynor Ratio and Value at Risk in the context of investment portfolios.

**Tools Used:** Google Sheets

## Key Concepts:
### Risk Management Techniques:
- Understanding and calculating Beta
- Calculating and interpreting the Treynor Ratio
- Estimating and analyzing Value at Risk (VaR)

### Methodology:
- Monthly returns analysis and standard deviation calculation
- Graphical representation of risk metrics
- Comparative analysis of investment risk factors

## Process and Insights:
- **Monthly Returns and Standard Deviation:** Analyzed the volatility and performance of investments using monthly returns and standard deviation.
- **Beta Calculation:** Calculated the beta of stocks to gauge their market volatility.
- **Treynor Ratio Calculation:** Calculated the Treynor Ratio to assess risk-adjusted returns of investments.
- **Value at Risk Analysis:** Estimated the maximum potential loss in an investment with Value at Risk.
- **Graphing and Conclusions:** Visualized key metrics for a clearer understanding of investment risks and performance.

## Key Findings:
Assessed investment risks and returns through the application of financial metrics, demonstrating the effective utilization of statistical methods in real-world investment scenarios to enhance risk assessment and management.

# Portfolio Optimization using Markowitz Model Project
This project uses the Markowitz Model, to optimize a two asset porfolio. Leveraging Excel alongside fundamental financial theories, the project successfully delineates the creation of an efficient frontier.

## Project Overview:
**Objective:** Build a Markowitz model to optimize a two-asset portfolio for the best risk/return ratio using the efficient frontier.

**Tools Used:** Excel
## Key Concepts:
### - Assets Analyzed:
 - VOO - Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF
 - BLV - Vanguard Long-Term Bond Index Fund ETF

### - Performance Metrics:
- Sharpe Ratio Calculation
- Standard Deviation
- Mean Returns

### - Assumption: 
 - Risk-Free Rate at 0.19% (Pre-Pandemic 2020 Monthly return of 10-year treasury bills)

## Process and Findings:
 - **Data Analysis:** Calculated mean returns based on the adjusted close for VOO and BLV.

 - **Risk Assessment:** Determined variance and standard deviation of returns.

 - **Sharpe Ratio:** Computed using the formula: 
(E(R) - Rf)/StdDev(Porfolio) where E(R) is the Expected Return of Portfolio, R_f is the Risk-Free Rate, and StdDev(Portfolio) is the Standard Deviation of the Portfolio.

 - **Correlation Analysis:** Examined the covariance and correlation between VOO and BLV.

 - **Portfolio Allocation:** Analyzed different asset allocations (e.g., 50% VOO, 50% BLV) and their impacts on portfolio metrics.
 
 - **Performance Metrics Analysis:** Evaluated mean return, variance, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio for various allocations.

## Key Findings:
- The 50/50 VOO and BLV allocation displayed the highest Sharpe ratio, indicating an optimal risk-to-return balance historically.
- Developed a plot of the efficient frontier, using standard deviation (risk) on the x-axis and mean return (reward) on the y-axis, and highlighted points with Sharpe Ratio labels.

## Conclusion:
This project represents an intersection between academic theory and practical application in the field of finance. It illustrates the effective use of the Markowitz Model in optimizing portfolio management, with a focus on empirical data analysis and risk assessment. Moreover, it underscores the significance of marrying robust statistical methods with practical market insights to forge more resilient and informed investment approaches.
